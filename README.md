## Assignment 4 Learning Objectives

### Part I
> Alumni Website:

- Create a database schema for an alumni website. Create a schema and database using the following list of web pages:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **- Home** – landing page, major highlights, courses, success stories, statistics and numbers  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **- Join** – registration by email address (ensure not campus email address as may expire), requires acceptance  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **- Login/Update** – member contact/information update  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **- Events** – CIT-related events (past, upcoming)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **- Blog** – monthly article by staff or alumni members  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  **- Contact**  


- Create a list of objects (entities) that would be required to deliver the functionality from the list of web pages. From this list of entities, create a list of tables that corresponds with these entities. Use MySQL Workbench to create a model with all of these entities. For each table, add an appropriate primary key (surrogate or natural).

- Export the model schema as an SQL file called `cit381-assign04-alumni.sql`.

- Pick three of the the tables (at least one with a relationship), and add any necessary properties and relationships. All relationships must also include relationship labels. You must also add at least five rows of data for these three tables. Export the data to a file called `cit381-assign04-data.sql`.

- To help with the properties and relationships, create a list of relationship "rules" that correlate with these three tables. Write out each rule using language similar to the boat-sailor examples on Canvas. You should have at least two rules for each relationship (relationships are bidirectional).

- Save these rules as `cit381-assign04-alumni-rules.txt`.

- Export a PNG image of the model, and save the image as `cit381-assign04-alumni.png`.

### Part II
> Queries:

- Write at least five queries that select data from the three tables.
- One of the queries must involve the two tables involved in a relationship.
- One of the queries must use a subquery.
- Save the queries in a file called `cit381-assign04-alumni-queries.sql`.
